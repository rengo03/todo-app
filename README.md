I used JavaScript to build the website's functionality and handle the interactions between the user and the database. Firebase was used for storing the to-do items and ensuring that the information was available in real-time across all devices. One of the biggest challenges I faced was implementing the real-time updates for the to-do list. I needed to make sure that any changes made by one user were reflected in real-time for all users.

## Functionalities

 - new tasks can be added to the list in real time on all devices.
 - completed tasks can be deleted in real time on all devices.
 - only the tasks can be viewed according to the selected status ("ALL", "Completed", "Active").
 - the number of unfinished tasks can be viewed
